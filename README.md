# **Earliest Detection Anomalies in Programmable Networks**

## **Project Description**  
The **Earliest Detection Anomalies in Programmable Networks** project focuses on developing an advanced system for the early detection of anomalies in Software-Defined Networks (SDN) and other programmable network environments. The goal is to ensure network stability, performance, and security by quickly identifying irregularities, such as unusual traffic patterns, latency spikes, or potential security threats. The solution leverages machine learning, network analytics, and automation to respond proactively to problems before they escalate.

This project is particularly relevant for network administrators and organizations that rely on dynamic and programmable infrastructures, including cloud providers, Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, and telecom operators.

## **Key Features**  
- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection**: Continuous monitoring to detect irregular network behaviors in real time.  
- **Programmable Network Compatibility**: Optimized for SDN, NFV (Network Function Virtualization), and other programmable network infrastructures.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, such as anomaly detection with Isolation Forest, autoencoders, and clustering techniques.  
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identifies the origin of anomalies, helping to address underlying issues efficiently.  
- **Automated Mitigation Actions**: Configures the network dynamically to respond to threats (e.g., isolating suspicious traffic).  
- **Visual Dashboards**: Interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring and reporting.  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large-scale networks and high traffic volumes.
