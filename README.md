# **Earliest Detection Anomalies in Programmable Networks with Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)**

## **Project Description**  
The **Earliest Detection Anomalies in Programmable Networks with DPI** project aims to develop an advanced anomaly detection system tailored for Software-Defined Networks (SDN) and other programmable infrastructures. This solution enhances traditional anomaly detection by incorporating **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)**, allowing the analysis of packet content beyond headers. This approach ensures more precise detection of malicious behavior, unusual traffic patterns, and protocol violations, empowering proactive security and performance management.  

The system is ideal for dynamic environments such as data centers, IoT deployments, and telecom networks, where early anomaly detection and fast response are critical to maintaining security and performance.

## **Key Features**  
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)**: Analyzes packet content and payloads to detect malicious activity or non-compliant protocols.  
- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection**: Monitors traffic continuously and identifies irregularities as they occur.  
- **Programmable Network Compatibility**: Supports SDN and NFV platforms, enabling flexible network reconfiguration in response to detected anomalies.  
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses algorithms like Isolation Forest, autoencoders, and clustering for both supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection.  
- **Root Cause Analysis and Reporting**: Identifies the source of issues and provides detailed logs and reports for further investigation.  
- **Automated Network Reactions**: Dynamically adjusts network flows (e.g., blocking suspicious traffic) based on detection events.  
- **Visual Dashboards**: Provides real-time monitoring with insightful visualizations of detected anomalies and network performance.  
- **Scalable and Extensible**: Optimized for large-scale networks with high traffic volumes.
